## Hi there! 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer intern at Arlemi. Currently, I'm studying Applied Computer Science at Poznań University of Life Sciences 🎓 I'm fascinated by the world of technology and always eager to take on new challenges. 💻💪

My skills encompass both front-end and back-end development. I enjoy creating beautiful and interactive user interfaces, but I'm also intrigued by the process of building efficient and scalable systems. 🌟🚀

Beyond coding, I have a passion for exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements. 🌱 I believe that continuous learning and growth are key to reaching new heights. In my free time, I also enjoy diving into thrilling crime novels, challenging my mind with Rubik's Cubes, and hitting the gym to stay fit and active. 📚🧩🏋️‍♀️
